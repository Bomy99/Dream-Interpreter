🧠 Dream Interpretation Tool - Try it out!

I built a cool dream interpretation app! Here's how to use it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Bomy99/Dream-Interpreter
2. Click the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Double-click "START.bat" (Windows) or run "python3 server.py" (Mac/Linux)
5. Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000/dream_matcher.html

That's it! Just type your dream and get an interpretation with tarot cards and everything.

Works completely offline - no internet needed after downloading!

Let me know what you think! 😊
